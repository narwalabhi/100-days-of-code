# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learnt Redux and implemented asynchronous API calls using redux-thunk in React.

**Thoughts:** I'm quite clear with the concept of using redux in react apps and why a middleware is needed to implement async API calls.

### Day 1: May 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Built the signin, profile pages using material-ui and integrated my authentication spring boot API using redux-hooks. 

**Thoughts:** Using redux-hooks is better and reduces the code overhead.
