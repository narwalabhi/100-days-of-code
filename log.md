# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learnt Redux and implemented asynchronous API calls using redux-thunk in React.

**Thoughts:** I'm quite clear with the concept of using redux in react apps and why a middleware is needed to implement async API calls.

**Link to work:** [Redux-thunk implementation](https://github.com/narwalabhi/blog-posts-redux-thunk-)
